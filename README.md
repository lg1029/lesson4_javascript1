### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1.(Javascript is the most popular scripting language that is used in millions of web pages all over to do a number of things like improve design/appearance, validate forms, detect browsers and create cookies. It works in all major browsers on the internet. Almost anyone can use Javascript without getting a license.)

2.(Javascript is NOT to be confused with Java. The difference is that they are two completely different languages, in design and concept. Java is a more complex language where programs are compiled and can be run as stand alone apps. Java is a strongly-typed language while Javascript is a loosely-typed language.)

3.(Basic syntax rules for Javascript are as follows: it is case-sensitive, it ignores whitespace within statements and each statement ends with a semicolon.)
